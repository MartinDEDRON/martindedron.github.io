All I want is to catch butterflies in your arms
The horizons of elsewhere mindscapes
Lipstick traces painted on my dreams
I want to please you with my soul


Colorful leaves are the one who fall

You swim, you swim
Getaway lakes 
Do I smell love 
Under your pines?
Is it the dust
Is it the wine
The getaway lakes 

I see myself as a river
That tried to flow into the sun

I can write what you can’t see
By all means and carefully 
To the meaning of our sin
On the pages of your skin
The only move that makes us be
Sole art of an eternity
Chanting the physical Poetry

Let me get harassed by the feelings of life
Into this world to feel the motion of the leaves
Let it cut through me like a knife
Cause it also moves me I conceive
Of all hopes our fingers can’t weave
The highest use us as a strife
That resolves in what we perceive

Scarlett phases of my mind
Going south still you can't find
Where it parts as we divide
Once nothing is left to hide

You maybe wanted in the morning
To remain as leftover dreams
In a whisper covering beams
With all the weight of a caring
That a new dawn cancelled it seems
Forever stay with just smiling
