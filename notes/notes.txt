<<<<<<< HEAD
Leave behind the samsara of haste, the obviousness of notifications.
Find peace in the disorganized, useless but above all, human, perceptions of your surroundings.

--

I intend through my work to make you wander.
Thus, photographs are displayed in places they 'shouldn't be' : seek, and you shall find.

--

Seek the subtle beauties that aren’t flashy enough to pierce through the overflowing stimulations that circle you like rainfall.
Escape.

--

Fin a different sun, an angle, an instant from which the mute spaces’ whispers reach you, and resonate with your being’s deepest harmonies. 

--

You choose whether you connect to the postmodern attention-seeking, or to the shy beauties that will never obviously call you.
Reach for what should truly be touching you. 

--

Through harmony
Immerse yourself
In communion.

--

Capture the winds and the warmth, the feelings and the unseen. 
That isn’t tangible: it lies in thin air.
This is my artistic research.
This is Harvesting Contemplations.

--

Harvesting Contemplations aims at conveying your attention towards what truly deserves it.
Shy beauties that aren’t tangible.
Overshadowed details. Modern brightness.
By printing my 600 best captures from ten years of travelling through life and exhibiting them in unexpected places, I invite you to look deeper.
To find a different stance, a different vision.
To embrace the subtlety of harmony.
This is an invitation to wander for the body and for the mind. Unknown destination tickets for the soul.

Keeping your eyes open,
Living slow,
Looking around you,
Harvesting Contemplations.
